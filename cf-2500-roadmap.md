# DSA Mastery Roadmap for Codeforces 2500+ (1 Year)

Duration: **1 Year (52 Weeks)**  
Daily Commitment: **3–5 focused hours**  
Primary Platform: **Codeforces**  
Target: **2500+ Codeforces rating + strong HFT-level problem-solving skills**

This roadmap is an enhanced, structured version of your existing plan. It adds a **clear Codeforces problem-selection guide** so you never "solve aimlessly" and always know **what to solve, when, and why**.

---

## 0. How to Use This Roadmap

1. Treat this as a **living document**. Adjust pacing slightly, but **never** relax the standards of consistency.
2. For every week, you get:
   - **Topics** to study
   - **Codeforces problem-selection rules** (difficulty ranges, tags, and quantities)
   - **Contest goals**
3. Always prioritize:
   - **Live contests → Upsolving → Targeted practice → Theory** (in that order of importance)
4. If short on time, **reduce new theory**, not contests or upsolving.

---

## 1. Daily & Weekly Structure (3–5 Hours)

### 1.1 Daily Templates

**Standard Day (≈5 hours)**
- **0.5 h – Warm-up**: 1–2 easy problems (slightly below your rating) from recent topics.
- **1.5–2 h – Targeted practice**: Problems chosen via the **problem-selection rules** for the current week.
- **1.5 h – New topic + linked problems**: Read theory and immediately apply to 2–4 problems.
- **1 h – Review & upsolving**: Revisit recent mistakes, solve unsolved problems, re-code editorial solutions.

**Contest Day (≈4–6 hours)**
- **0.5 h – Warm-up**: 1–2 very easy problems just to get typing and thinking.
- **2–2.5 h – Rated or virtual contest**.
- **1.5–3 h – Upsolving**: For every unsolved contest problem:
  - Spend 20–30 minutes thinking.
  - Then read editorial, write full solution from scratch.

**Light Day (≈3 hours)**
- **1 h – Weak-topic practice** (e.g., a topic you recently struggled with).
- **1–2 h – Mixed problemset / virtual contest**.
- If very tired: 3–4 easy/medium problems + some theory revision.

### 1.2 Weekly Minimums

Every week, aim for:

- **Problems solved**: 40–70 (depends on phase; detailed later).
- **Contests**: **3+** (live) or **2 live + 1–2 virtual** if schedule is tight.
- **Upsolving**: All "interesting" unsolved problems from contests within **24 hours**.

---

## 2. Codeforces Problem-Selection System (No Aimless Solving)

This section tells you exactly **how to pick problems on Codeforces** so practice is always deliberate.

### 2.1 Rating-Based Rules

Let \(R\) be your current Codeforces rating.

**Core rule:**

- **60%** of problems: difficulty in **[R − 200, R]**
- **30%** of problems: difficulty in **[R, R + 200]**
- **10%** of problems: difficulty in **[R + 200, R + 300]**

If you are **below 1400**, use absolute ranges instead:

- 800–1000 → for warm-up/implementation
- 1000–1300 → main practice
- 1300–1500 → stretch problems

When the roadmap states something like **"30 problems (20 easy, 10 medium)"**, interpret as:

- Easy: your **current rating −200 to −100** or difficulty band specified for that month.
- Medium: around your rating, sometimes slightly above.

### 2.2 Topic-Based Filtering on Codeforces

When choosing problems from the Codeforces Problemset:

1. Use the **difficulty filter** according to your current week.
2. Use **tags** matching the current topic (e.g., `two pointers`, `graphs`, `dp`, `data structures`, `binary search`).
3. Sort by **"Unsolved" or "By number of solves"**:
   - Early phases: prefer problems with **many solves** (high acceptance).
   - Later phases: mix in problems with **moderate solves** to expose yourself to trickier ideas.
4. Select problems **manually but quickly**:
   - If statement looks very implementation-heavy with no new idea, **skip** (unless week focus is implementation).
   - If problem has editorial and fits your topic and difficulty, **add it to your queue**.

### 2.3 Contest vs Problemset Balance

- **Early months (1–3)**: 
  - 50–60% of practice = problemset by topic.
  - 40–50% = contests + upsolving.
- **Middle months (4–7)**:
  - ~40% topic-wise problemset.
  - ~60% contests, virtual contests, and upsolving (focus on Div 2).
- **Late months (8–12)**:
  - 20–30% topic polishing.
  - 70–80% Div 1 / tougher contests and upsolving.

### 2.4 How to Upsolve Effectively

For each contest:

1. **List all problems you didn’t solve or solved with guesswork.**
2. Process them in order of difficulty.
3. For each problem:
   - Spend **20–30 minutes** re-thinking without help.
   - If still stuck, read **only the first hint** you can find (discussion or partial editorial).
   - Try again; if still stuck, read full editorial, then:
     - Write the code from scratch.
     - Add the problem to a **"revisit" list**.
4. Every weekend, pick 3–5 revisit problems and solve them again from zero.

- 20 contests in a month if feasible (rated + virtual).  
- Start HFT-style interview prep (shorter, implementation-heavy but tricky problems).

---

## 5. Flexibility & Recovery Rules

### If You’re Behind (Rating >100 Points Below Target)

- Add **+1 hour/day** for the next **2 weeks**.
- Temporarily **de-prioritize exotic topics** (FFT, HLD, persistent DS) and:
  - Focus on **graphs, DP, greedy, data structures**, and contest problems.
- Increase contest frequency to **4–5 per week** (live + virtual).

### If You’re Ahead

- In Months 1–5: Add depth—do **harder problems in the same topics**.
- In Months 6–9: Start **Div 1** problems earlier and more aggressively.
- In Months 10–12: Focus on **stability and consistency**, not just peak rating.

### Weekly Checkpoint (Every Sunday)

Ask yourself:

- Did I solve the **target number of problems** this week?
- Did I participate in **3+ contests**?
- Did I **upsolve all notable unsolved contest problems**?
- Is my rating within **±50 points of the phase target**?
- Do I **understand** the ideas, or am I just memorizing editorial code?

If multiple answers are negative, treat next week as a **fix week**: lower new theory, increase review and targeted practice.

---

## 6. Contest Strategy (Throughout the Year)

### Early (Weeks 1–12)

- Primary contests: **Div 3 and Div 4**.
- Frequency: **2–3 per week**.
- Focus:
  - Fast, accurate solutions for A/B/C.
  - Learn how to **read statements quickly** and detect patterns.

### Intermediate (Weeks 13–24)

- Primary contests: **Div 2**, with some Div 3 as speed drills.
- Frequency: **3–4 per week** (live + virtual).
- Focus:
  - Consistently solving **3–4 problems**.
  - Attempting Div 2 D every time, upsolving it afterward.

### Advanced (Weeks 25–36)

- Primary contests: **Div 2 + start Div 1**.
- Frequency: **4–5 per week**.
- Focus:
  - Solve A/B/C in Div 2 very fast.
  - Start solving **Div 1 A**, occasionally **Div 1 B**.

### Expert (Weeks 37–52)

- Primary contests: **Div 1**.
- Frequency: **5+ per week** including virtuals.
- Focus:
  - Reliable **2–3 solves per Div 1 round**.
  - Use virtuals to simulate pressure and new problem types.

### Virtual Contest Usage

- Use virtuals to **fill gaps between live contests**.
- Always simulate **real-time pressure** and no peeking.
- After virtual ends, upsolve as if it were rated.

---

## 7. Critical Success Factors & Pitfalls

### Must-Haves

- **Consistency**: At most **one zero-practice day per week**.
- **Contests**: Minimum **3 contests per week**.
- **Upsolving**: Every important unsolved contest problem must be revisited within **24 hours**.
- **Editorials**: Read to understand **ideas**, not to copy code.
- **Speed**: Constantly reduce average solve time, especially for A/B/C problems.
- **Templates**: Maintain reliable templates for IO, graph, DSU, segment tree, etc.

### Avoid

- **Tutorial hell**: Consuming theory without solving real problems.
- **Comfort-zone grinding**: Only doing problems you already know how to solve.
- **Rating obsession**: Focus on improving skills; rating will follow.
- **Skipping contests**: Fear-based avoidance kills progress.
- **Total isolation**: Discuss tricky problems with others when stuck.

---

## 8. Tracking & Review

Maintain a simple spreadsheet or markdown table with columns like:

- Week
- Topics
- Problems solved
- Contests (count + brief notes)
- Rating start/end
- Notes (what went well, what went wrong)

At the end of each **month**, write down:

- Strongest topics.
- Weakest topics.
- Target rating for next month.
- 3 concrete adjustments for the next month (more contests, more DP, etc.).

---

## 9. Reality Check & Mindset

- This is an **extremely aggressive** roadmap. Even if you fall short of 2500, reaching **2200–2400** will already put you in a fantastic position for HFT interviews and top-tier programming skill.
- Focus on **deliberate practice** and **long-term consistency**, not quick rating spikes.
- Accept that you will have **slumps and rating drops**. After each drop, analyze what happened, adjust, and continue.
- Protect your **health and sleep**; burnout will destroy even the best plan.

Stay disciplined, keep your problem selection deliberate using the rules above, and use contests as your main testing ground. If you stick to this for 52 weeks, your level will be dramatically higher, regardless of the exact final rating.
