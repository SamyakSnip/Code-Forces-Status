#### Week 1 – Arrays, Two Pointers, Sliding Window

**Topics**
- Arrays, prefix sums.
- Two pointers, sliding window.
- Simple implementation and math.

**Codeforces Problem Selection**
- Daily total: **6–8 problems**.
- Difficulty bands:
  - 3–4 problems in **800–1000** with tags: `implementation`, `two pointers`, `greedy`.
  - 2–3 problems in **1000–1200** with tags: `two pointers`, `prefix sums`.
- Strategy:
  - Start each day with **2 very easy implementation problems**.
  - Then pick **2 problems tagged `two pointers`** (one easy, one medium).
  - End with **1 prefix sums or simple math problem**.

**Contests (2 Div 3/Div 4)**
- Aim to solve **A, B, and attempt C**.
- After contest, upsolve **all A–C**, even if solved, to solidify patterns.

**Success Criteria**
- Comfortable recognizing two-pointer/sliding-window patterns.
- Can implement them with almost no bugs.
